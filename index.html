      <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in C language and manipulating it
        to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems.
        Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power
        of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.

      </p>

      <p>
        I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look
        amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages.

      </p>

      <p>
        My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, domain driven
        design, responsive design principles, website optimization, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of
        organizing code. So far I have C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Python, and Git/GitHub . I've
        started learning Angular, .NET
        Framework. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I
        can integrate into the coding web in my head.
